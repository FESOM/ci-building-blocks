# CI Building Blocks

This repository contains some common CI tasks which you might need for (in
particular in `Python`) projects to help you do things like:

* [x] Build a container out of your project
* [ ] Activate automatic tests
* [ ] Publish your code on new tag pushes

It is still work in progress, but feel free to use for inspiration, and most importantly please **add to it!!!**.
